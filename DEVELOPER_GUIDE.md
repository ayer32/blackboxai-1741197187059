# Developer Guide for NetManEthics

## Introduction
This guide is intended for developers who want to contribute to the NetManEthics project. It provides an overview of the code structure, module descriptions, and guidelines for extending the application.

## Code Structure
The project is organized into several modules, each responsible for specific functionalities. The main components are:

- **modules/network_management/**: Contains modules for network management, including:
  - `network_discovery.py`: Implements functions for discovering devices on the network.
  - `network_diagnostics.py`: Provides tools for diagnosing network issues, including ping and traceroute.
  - `traffic_monitoring.py`: Monitors network traffic in real-time.
  - `wifi_scanning.py`: Scans for available WiFi networks.
  - `device_info.py`: Retrieves information about connected devices.
  
- **modules/security/**: Contains modules for security-related tasks, including:
  - `deauth_attack.py`: Implements deauthentication attacks on wireless networks.
  - `beacon_flooding.py`: Floods the network with fake beacons.
  - `evil_twin.py`: Creates rogue access points.
  - `wpa_cracking.py`: Implements WPA/WPA2 cracking functionality.
  - `port_scanning.py`: Scans target devices for open ports.
  - `firewall_management.py`: Manages firewall rules.
  - `intrusion_detection.py`: Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity.

- **modules/reporting/**: Contains modules for reporting and log analysis, including:
  - `log_analysis.py`: Analyzes system and network logs.
  - `report_generation.py`: Generates reports in various formats.
  - `incident_reporting.py`: Logs and manages security incidents.

- **modules/visualization/**: Contains modules for data visualization, including:
  - `data_visualization.py`: Visualizes network traffic and scan results.

- **utils/**: Contains utility functions and classes, such as logging.

- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for each module to ensure code quality and functionality.
